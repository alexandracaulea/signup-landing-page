# Recreated "Sign up Landing Page" project using React

I've taken the 'Sign up landing page' project and recreated it using React.

This project was initially created using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript; you can
check the
[code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/working-with-apis/tree/main/Sign%20up%20Landing%20Page)
or the initial live [example](https://codepen.io/alexandracaulea/full/mdygyxV).

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`
- `npm run build`
